Vanialla Javascript, html, css, Web Socket, and a vartiey of NPM Modules.

This project was to further my javascript skills. This utlizes Alpaca's free API to stream incoming quotes, candles and orders to disply live on a chart and feed. The chart looks empty due to the frequency of trades taking place on Alpacas exchange. Prior to the 3rd version of the alpaca API, data was provied on various exchnages, however that is no longer the case.

## Work Weather app - Mobile Only
React.js, Javscript, HTML/CSS, and a variety of NPM Modules.

Interesting story to this project, per the repository it is easy to see the uglinessness of the code structure, however this is due to the speed in which it was creaetd. In the postion of an event director monitoring the weather specifally for precipitation amount (inches) and precipitation probability is cruical. The motivation of this project was we needed the most accurate data possible for out given location. Therfore, I created a mobile only web based weather app to display the most accurate data using an open source weather API while getting rid of the uneeded extras. **Mobile Only**
