## Work Weather app - Mobile Only
React.js, Javscript, HTML/CSS, and a variety of NPM Modules.

Interesting story to this project, per the repository it is easy to see the uglinessness of the code structure, however this is due to the speed in which it was creaetd. In the postion of an event director monitoring the weather specifally for precipitation amount (inches) and precipitation probability is cruical. The motivation of this project was we needed the most accurate data possible for out given location. Therfore, I created a mobile only web based weather app to display the most accurate data using an open source weather API while getting rid of the uneeded extras. **Mobile Only**
